# 문장

>Possibly anthropoid apes may resemble us in this
respect, **as in so many others**, but having never
lived with them I have not had the opportunity to
make the experiment.

유인원들이 **많은 방면에서 우리를 닮은 것 처럼**, 이러한 부분에서도 우리를 닮았을 수 있다.

> Boredom is
essentially a thwarted desire for events, not
necessarily pleasant ones, but just occurrences
such as will enable the victim of ennui to **know one
day from another**.

하루하루를 구별할 수 있게 해 줄 그런 사건

> In like manner
no one has ever yawned during his maiden speech
in the House of Lords, with the exception of the
late Duke of Devonshire, who was reverenced by
their Lordships **in consequence**.

데본셔 공작을 제외하고 누구도 첫 연설중에 하품을 하지 않았는데, 데본셔 공작은 하품을 **했고 그 결과로** 존경을 받았다.

>They were not allowed
to read, or to leave the room, because the theory
was that at that period their father conversed with
them, which must be a pleasure to all concerned.

>It must have been boredom as much as anything that
led to the practice of witch-hunts as the sole sport
by which winter evenings could be enlivened.
